Toddler year, basically I don’t remember anything about my toddler year because I am only little that day and, 
I don’t have picture because we don’t have any phones and camera, we live a very simple life the only thing 
I know is that I was attack by a chicken and also I wait for a ship in the middle of the road that was my mom said.<p>
